**From Pranjal Gupta, on VEX Team 9204A/B**

This library was originally created as a summer project to understand the math and code behind arc-based odometry and simple move-to-point functions. It has now been implemented within the 9204B codebase for the 2025-26 V5RC Push Back season, giving us autonomous wins over 80% of teams we have faced off this season until now.

Teams can feel free to look inside the library to see sections of code to understand the code behind these concepts. It is advised against using this library as a competitive team without understanding everything behind this, as it can lead to potential \<G4\> and \<G5\> violations.
